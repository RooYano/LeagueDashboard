# League Dashboard

I am attempting to create a web app in the form of a customizable dashboard to keep track of popular League of Legends Pro players. I want something that I can choose which players to follow and provides their match schedule all in one screen. Maybe create box modules that include things such as their soloQ match history, recent performance in a progame, their next matchup against another player you follow, and status if the player is currently streaming on twitch. With these boxes, I can lay them out however I want on my dashboard. The bustom dashboard should be saved to individual user's account so add username/password login. 
My stack is MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js   

 ## Phase 1  
-Have a working frontend-backend (using https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-build-a-basic-crud-app-with-node-js-and-reactjs/ as a template)  
-Use lol-esports-api to pull schedule data from lolesports.com  
-Create interface to tie players to their respective teams  
-Add log in feature  

## Phase 2  
-Create the box modules  
-Add function to add more boxes or delete boxes  
-Make it move around  

## Phase 3
-Add chat feature like twitch so you can have this dashboard open while watching with friends?  
-AAdd SoloQ performance or search features to look up stats from progames or their SoloQ games
